A good practice is to set the visibility flag is on <code>viewDidDisappear</code> and <code>viewDidAppear</code> methods.</p>\n<pre><code>- (void)viewDidDisappear:(BOOL)animated\n{\n [super viewDidDisappear:animated];\n banner.visible = NO;\n }\n\n- (void)viewDidAppear:(BOOL)animated\n{\n banner.visible = YES;\n [super viewDidAppear:animated];\n}\n</code></pre>"
