// @brief:
// The SADetails class contains fine grained information about the creative
// of an ad (such as width, iamge, vast, tag, etc)
// Depending on the format of the creative, some fields are essential,
// and some are optional
//
// This dependency is regulated by SAValidator.h
@interface SADetails : NSObject

// the width & height of the creative; can be applied to images, banners,
// rich-media, etc
// there are cases when this is 1 x 1 - which indicates a relative-size
// creative
@property (nonatomic, assign) NSInteger width;
@property (nonatomic, assign) NSInteger height;

// in case creative format is image_with_link, this is the URL of the image
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *image;

// name of the creative
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *name;

// in case creative format is video, this is the URL of the video to be streamed
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *video;

// in case creative format is video, this is the video bitrate
@property (nonatomic, assign) NSInteger bitrate;

// in case creative format is video, this is the total duration

// in case creative format is video, this is the associated vast tag
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *vast;

// in case creative format is tag, this is the JS tag
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *tag;

// this is the placement format, defined in SAPlacementFormat.h
// as of now, it's kind of useless
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *placementFormat;

// in case creative format is rich media, this is the URL to the zip with all
// media resources; at the moment it's not used, but could be used when doing
// truly preloaded ads
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *zip;

// in case creative format is rich media, this is the URL of the rich media
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSString *url;

// aux value needed when sending ad data like rating and such
