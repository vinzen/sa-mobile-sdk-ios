 * Default values are loaded from the ADTECHAdConfiguration.plist file when the ATBannerView gets created.

 * The placement identifying details can be set on the concrete configuration instances ATAdtechAdConfiguration or ATGenericAdConfiguration

 * The ADTECHAdConfiguration.plist comes with preset values and you can change them to your convenience.
